        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 
        eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard 
        (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two 
        bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by 
        striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and 
        then running between the wickets, while the bowling and fielding 
        side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving 
        the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter 
        (so they are "out"). </p>

        <p><strong>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game </strong>played between two teams of 
            eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard 
            (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two 
            bails balanced on three stumps. <em>The batting side scores runs by 
            striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and 
            then running between the wickets,</em> while the bowling and fielding 
            side tries to prevent this (by preventing the ball from leaving 
            the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss each batter 
            (so they are "out").<ins>Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the 
            ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails</ins>and by the fielding side 
            either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits 
            the ground, or hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross 
            the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters have been dismissed, 
            the innings ends and the teams swap roles. <mark>The game is adjudicated by two 
            umpires, aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches.</mark> 
            <del>They communicate with two off-field scorers who record the match's statistical 
                information.</del></p>
